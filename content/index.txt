# Hello!

Welcome to my personal website.  
For now I'm posting blog posts about anything that comes to mind and is worth a blog post, and wiki entries that are going to be mostly about tech, specifically Linux.

I spend a lot of time with computer science and technology in my free time and stumble upon a lot of problems and set up a lot of things, so why not share these things. Maybe you will get something out of it. Maybe I'll even save you hours of figuring out where a problem lies with my wiki entries, who knows.

This website will work without JavaScript, so feel free to disable it.  
I'm also trying to keep this website as accessible and lightweight as possible, so don't expect to see any pictures here for now.

Here are some of the most important links, should you be on mobile and can't see the navbar. I'm still trying to figure out a good solution without bringing in unnecessary JavaScript.
